ideas:

- text sentiment analysis (how positive is the discussion) for different stars (bron vs KD)
- word2vec -> which words are similar to kevin durrant? (predicting people's teammates)
	-> associate players with words (stephen curry & 3 points/injury)
- how controversial are stars based on comments? (do people think good or bad about these players?) (business oriented)
- generate articles



Build binary model to see if an article is about Lebron James or not
Or predict WHICH player an article is about
